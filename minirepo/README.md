# minirepo

A monorepo template, using Nix, `direnv` and Bazel.

This repository is designed to act as a skeleton for those wishing to use Bazel
to build code in a monorepository. It uses Nix to complement Bazel's hermetic
builds with a hermetic system environment and `direnv` to make this implicitly
available when users `cd` into the repository's directory. At present this
template supports the following:

* A set of Nixpkgs pins designed to provide flexible control over which versions
  of which packages and toolchains are available.

* A Haskell toolchain designed for building _fully-statically-linked binaries_,
  that is, binaries with _no dynamic linking_. Such binaries have minimal
  runtime dependencies and are thus easy to deploy, whether standalone or in
  bare-minimum Docker containers (as supported by e.g. `rules_docker`).

* A Docker toolchain capable of building Docker containers with binaries and
  outputs from this repository (such as the aforementioned static Haskell
  binaries).

## Layout

* `nix` contains Nix code for pinning package sets and tools used to make
  working in this repository reproducible.

* `direnv` contains Bash scripts for having the aforementioned Nix tools be
  added to your `PATH` whenever you are working in this repository. These
  scripts also take care of caching to minimise the performance hits when
  `cd`ing in and out of this repository. `.envrc` in the repository root is the
  file which `direnv` will look for when `cd`ing into this repository and is a
  symlink into the `direnv` directory, which we use to keep things neat.

* `WORKSPACE` defines the Bazel workspace and includes rules for building
  Haskell code, Docker containers, etc. It pulls in definitions from the `bazel`
  directory.

* `example-service` defines an example Haskell service, with a library `ifc`
  (short for "interface") and a binary `impl` (short for "implementation"). Its
  `BUILD.bazel` file defines targets for these two things as well as some other
  test cases (e.g. REPLs, Docker images, Haddock documentation, etc.).

* `hie.yaml` and `.hie-bios` are files that use the aforementioned Bazel rules
  to configure GHCIDE to work with the Haskell projects in this repository.

* Booting up GHCIDE directly for local development (check out `hie.yaml` and
  `.hie-bios`)
